# Glow Daze

## Project Description
Glow Daze is a vibrant, interactive website dedicated to the mascot of the Graphic Design Club at RIT Dubai. The mascot, Glow Daze (an Arctic Fox), is presented as a bright, playful character designed to spark creativity across campus. The site functions as a hub for the mascot's world, featuring interactive character bios, comics, fun activities, and a sticker gallery.

## Features

The website includes the following interactive sections and features:

* **Characters:** An interactive carousel to view the main character, Glow Daze, and her friends (Rocky, Lana, Finn) and professors (Professor Rexford, Professor Mirella). Each profile includes species, personality, and "vibe" descriptions.
* **Comics:** A dedicated section with covers and a full-screen reader view for enjoying the latest adventures.
* **Activities:** A collection of downloadable, fun resources, including:
    * Coloring Pages
    * Mazes
    * Word Search
    * Crossword Puzzle
    * Connect the Dots
    * Spot the Differences
* **Stickers:** A collectible sticker gallery with a carousel/pagination for browsing.
* **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** A persistent toggle switch in the header that allows users to switch between a light and a dark theme.
* **Visual Effects:** Features a dynamic snowflake background and a subtle mouse sparkle trail.
* **Responsive Navigation:** Includes a hamburger menu for navigation on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (for structure)
* **CSS3** (for styling, animations, and dark mode theming)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (for interactivity, carousels, dark mode logic, and dynamic content rendering)
* **Custom Font:** 'Sailors'

## Installation and Setup

This is a static website and can be run locally or hosted directly.

1.  **Clone the repository** (Assuming this code is part of a larger project):
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Glow Daze
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`** in your web browser.

The JavaScript code expects a specific file structure for assets (e.g., `char_glowdaze.png`, `covers/chapter_1.png`, `activites/maze/maze_easy_1.pdf`, `stickers/Glow Daze Smart.png`, `fonts/Sailors.otf`, etc.) to function correctly.
